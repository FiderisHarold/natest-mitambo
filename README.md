Programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer software to accomplish a specific computing task.
It involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task, which can be as complex as operating a system of interconnected devices or as simple as displaying a message on the screen.
